## What You're Seeing

These are **standalone previews** - they don't connect to a real database or API. They show:

### ✅ Visual Design:
- Color scheme (sage green, cream, rose gold)
- Typography (Playfair Display serif + DM Sans)
- Layout and spacing
- Component styles (buttons, tables, cards)
- Responsive behavior (try resizing your browser!)

### ❌ NOT Functional:
- Buttons don't do anything
- Forms don't submit
- Links just go to #
- No real data (using mock/placeholder data)

## Next Steps

After reviewing these:

1. **Give feedback** - What do you like? What to change?
2. **Move to Venue section** - See venue dashboard designs
3. **Move to Customer section** - See customer experience
4. **Finalize all designs** - Lock everything in
5. **Start building** - Turn these into real React components

---

## Notes

These previews use **Tailwind CSS CDN** for styling, which is why they work standalone. The real React components will use the same Tailwind classes but compiled properly.

Fonts are loaded from Google Fonts CDN, so you need an internet connection to see the correct typography.
